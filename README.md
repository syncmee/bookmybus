## Flow Map for BookMyBus

**1. User Journey**  
Start: User Opens the App  

**User Authentication**:
  - Login/Signup Page
  - User enters credentials.
  - If the user selects "Remember Me," a session is stored.
  - Credentials are validated via the backend (Flask + SQLite).
  - If invalid, display an error message.
  - If valid, redirect to the dashboard.

**Search Buses**:
- User enters:
    - Departure City
    - Destination City
    - Date of Journey (via Flatpickr Date Picker)
  - Backend fetches available buses based on the search criteria from the database.
  - Results display in a list with:
    - Bus Names
    - Timings (in 24-hour format)
    - Availability Status
    - Price

**Bus Selection**:
  - User selects a bus.
  - The system shows:
    - Bus Details (Seats, Timing, Amenities, etc.)
    - Seat Layout (Available/Booked seats indicated)
    - Real-time seat availability (Seats update in real-time)

**Seat Selection**:
  - User selects their seat(s).
  - The system updates the UI to mark selected seats and lock them temporarily.
  - The system checks:
    - If selected seats are still available.
    - If unavailable, display a message.
    - If available, proceed.

**Booking Confirmation**:
  - User confirms the booking.
  - User provides personal and payment details.
  - Payment Gateway Interaction (optional in this flow map).
  - Backend processes the booking:
    - Updates the seat status in the database.
    - Generates a booking confirmation.
    - Redirects to the booking success page.

**Booking History**:
  - User is redirected to the Dashboard showing:
    - Upcoming trips.

**2. Backend Processes**  

**Database Interaction (PostgreSQL)**:
  - Bus Search: Fetch available buses based on route and date.
  - Seat Availability Check: Query the database to check which seats are available or booked.
  - User Authentication: Validate login credentials.
  - Booking Confirmation: Update the seat booking status and store user booking information.

**Session Management**:
  - The system manages user sessions for authenticated users and handles session timeouts.
  - If "Remember Me" is checked, the userâ€™s session lasts longer until they log out manually.
